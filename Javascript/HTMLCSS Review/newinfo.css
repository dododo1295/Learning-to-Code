/* rem and em measurements
you see both but try to prefer rem.
1em is the font-size of an element (or the element’s parent if you’re using it to set font-size).
So, for example, if an element’s font-size is 16px, then setting its width to 4em would make its width 64px 
(16 * 4 == 64).
1rem is the font-size of the root element (either :root or html). 
The math works the same with rem as it did with em, but without the added complexity of keeping track of 
the parent’s font size. Relying on em could mean that a particular size could change if the context changes, 
which is very likely not the behavior you want. */

/* vw and vh measurements are relative to the viewport. 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width, and 1vh is
equal to 1% of the viewport height. */
